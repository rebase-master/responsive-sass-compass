# Responsive Single Page Layouts
This project is for my course Responsive Single Page Layouts. It uses Sass, Compass, Susy 2.0 and shows a variety of techniques including dockable menus, responsive grids, tween and parallax effects, etc.

## This repo is created after following the SASS/Compass tutorial by Ray Villalobos of LinkedIn. The original repository is here: https://github.com/planetoftheweb/responsive
